I didn't think it was possible to peak into my summer experience this early on, but I think I've done so. I've never been higher -- quite literally -- in terms of quality of life, busy-ness, and stimulation. Those are all qualities of my ideal lifestyle, and I think this week was a microcosm of that.

As always, an insane week always starts with a slow ebb, and Monday was no exception. It was filled with rather tedious errands, chilling, and by little actions that would have larger repercussions later in the week.

Those little moments of downtime and normalcy, though, were so critical for holding together my life during the crazier, more spontaneous moments. Calm and crazy, productive and unproductive, they work together like yin and yang, where you can't have one without the other. Well, maybe you could have unproductivity without productivity :) but thats besides the point ... all I have to say is that these little non-insane highlighted moments are important.

But in any case, by the middle and latter end of the week, things started to shift away from productivity and towards the exploratory end of the spectrum. For example, while going on a couple first dates, I ran into a bunch of areas I didn't even know existed ... what a pleasant surprise!

My favorite place was trudging around Chinatown while feeling gloomy on a Wednesday evening, and remembering a wicked cool place I had seen on IG...

Boba and other Asiatic-flavored cream puffs and mochi donuts?? I could die in heaven right now. Diet that I am on, I couldn't resist trying out some of the unique flavors, and it was totally worth the extra cals.

In order of increasing oishi-ness, it would be matcha mochi donut, boba cream puff, and milk and honey cream puff. I was actually surprised that I wasn't blown away by the boba cream puff -- it tasted good, don't get me wrong, but there was no "wow" factor. It tasted just like boba in a donut. BUT, the milk and honey cream puff ... now THAT was absolutely delicious. I'm a sucker for dairy, and the cream was nothing like I had ever had before. Even if the others were more of a novelty, that one was a 10/10, must try. Definitely gotta go back at some point to try the other flavors.
