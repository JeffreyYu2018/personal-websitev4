You ever hear that quote, “you are the average of the five people closest to you”? Apropos to that quote, I’m not sure what this week of hanging out with friends implies about me. It’s an interesting question that I like to ask to my friends. Their five people have remained static and steady, and are illustrative of a solidified sense of identity. Whereas for me, my five people are constantly changing, and I think that says a lot about the self-growth and inner change I’ve been undergoing. 

I think about identity a lot, especially as a type A person who is constantly looking forwards to squeeze the most out of opportunities that life ahead. For example, on Monday, I received my Light award, and discovered that ICLP’s online program doesn’t start until late September, which is SUPER late. Now, I’m cool with having free time, but I found it difficult to digest that I would have a month and a half of *nothing* between my internship and classes. A month and a half is a ton of time, and having an extra 40 hours a week feels like more time than I’ve had in forever. As I sat down to think about it, I felt paralyzed by the cornucopia of choice. What would I focus on? Recruiting? Travel? Housing? Hobbies?

Maybe it was in an unconscious aversion to making a decision right away, that I was so drawn to procrastinating in the present. “Foodie and Me Mondays” have become an enjoyable, comparatively lower-energy-intensive regular set of time in my schedule. They’re the antithesis to my natural inclinations to introspectively forward-think, as I use them to do menial errands and low brainpower tasks. The balance helps keep me honest.

I’m not sure what it is about new environments, but an adventure to a new shop always brings out the best thoughtful side of me. Maybe it’s the lack of familiarity that forces me to embrace new ideas, rather than cling to the routine. In any case, I’ve officially become a “cafe boi,” not for the food or drink, but rather, for the ambience and novelty. This week, the lucky loser was a place that kept getting highlighted on IG: Prince Tea House in East Village.

Most places I’ve visited are quaint and have a nice ambience or selection of foods, but usually not both. I don’t go into cafes with any expectations usually, beyond that they stay open past a certain hour to accomodate my late-night blogging habits. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned this week, it’s that a surprise is constantly lurking around the corner. In this case, it was very literal! Nestled away on the corner of an intersection between a park and commercial area, this cafe was built for electronic work. There was an outlet, WiFi (albeit slow), and adorable decor. Cushy seats, innovative desserts, and nonintrusive staff. Out of all the places I’ve blogged, from lake benches to 24-hour cafes, this place killed it and has made it to the top of my list.

I don’t mean to sound shallow, but materialist experience really does wonders for mood. Like the cafe’s brown sugar boba mille crepe cake, which I suspected of being gimmicky at first, was surprisingly delicious and multi-dimensional in flavor. The burnt creme brûlée texture at the top added a nice pungent, sweet bite to an otherwise innocent and one-noted dish. I don’t want to go full Anthony Bourdain, but not only did each bite quite literally raise my serotonin levels, but the surprise of the entire endeavor gave me faith in the future. A positive experience could be just a bite away.

For me, nothing better complements a fresh heaping of surprise with a dose of freedom. I loved walking around the East Village one, needing out over little landmarks and gems that spiced up my day. The best way of describing the motivation is, avoiding predictability by flirting with uncertainty. 

![being unpredictable ... like this funny sign](../uploads/071921_funny_pizza_sign_east_village.jpeg "being unpredictable ... like this funny sign")

The walk cleared my mind. Suddenly, I could put my dating drama back into perspective, and rekindle my hope in brighter weeks to follow.

One of the timeliness themes of this week has been relinquishing my grip over my thoughts, while living in the moment. It seems contradictory, but as I’ve advanced further in my meditation journey, I’ve learned they aren’t the same.  

An important skill that I practice each morning, under the tutelage of the Waking Up app, is resetting my frame and beginning my focus again. It’s about relinquishing what happened in the past, and giving myself a fresh start. 

Now, I love self-reflection and planning ahead way more than the average person, so this practice is antithetical to my natural behavior. But, this type of state of being is the foundation of forgiveness, which is rooted in moving on from the past, and also resilience, which is giving the present your full attention once again. 

It’s powerful stuff, the idea that we always have the option to move past a story we’ve been saying to ourselves, and regard doubt as a transient appearance in consciousness instead of permanent companion. For me, it allows me to fully enjoy the present while maintaining a clear view into the future. 

Tuesday evening, I got my first taste of what it was like to live in the present after my dance class. I stopped by my gym to chat with Lydia and EJ, two of the front desk staff I befriended early on, in a totally unplanned encounter. I pass them everyday on the way to my workout, but I never had the time to sit and catch up. That Tuesday evening, in a moment of breaking out of my autopilot routine, I figured it’d be a good use of my extra time. So we chatted, about the Fourth of July, about the nyc dating market, and about city life. 

These supportive, friendly, genuine conversations brings me back to the initial quote that kick started this blog.

Not only has the group of five people changed so much for me, but the context surrounding those hangouts has as well. I’ve discovered a suppressed appetite for adventure and spontaneity that I didn’t know I’d kept holed up all these years. Hangouts that were filled with Super Smash Bros matches or casual lunchtime chats had been supplanted by dynamic activities like skydiving and board games. 

![this Filipino-Mexican meal was sponsored by EY and was delicious, but meals had no longer the social highlight of my week](../uploads/072121_ey_sponsored_meal_mexican_filipino.jpeg "this Filipino-Mexican meal was sponsored by EY and was delicious, but meals had no longer the social highlight of my week")

It might seem silly — “of course, everyone loves doing those things! Isn’t everyone like that?” Well, for me, I wasn’t. But now that I’ve tried it out, I’m hooked and don’t know if I can go back to my old lifestyle without guilt. 

By now, that adventurous tendency has manifested in the form of a 100+ item list of things to do in NYC. Each and every week, I make the effort to knock out two or three items off of it, with the goal being to hit one place per day on average. One such hidden gem was kayaking on the NYC harbor, and unlike my past self, this time I found a spontaneous and active friend willing to go with me on such a trip: Han, a friend of Meaghan.

Excitement. That’s all that was on my mind as I waited for the minutes of work to tick down, and in my body as I sprint-biked down the coast of Manhattan to pier 26, and in my chest as I saw the kayaks floating on the pristine water on a stunning day.

Wonder. That’s what was in my mind as we joint-explored the new neighborhood of Tribeca.

But I had planned those two activities, and they couldn’t hold a torch to the best emotion of all: surprise. The cherry on top of the cake was the spontaneous outing at the end of the day to Mango Mango, a child time favorite dessert place with a lot of nostalgic meaning.

* The social momentum kept building up. After slugging through technical work and future planning on Thursday, I reaped the fruits (or should I say, meats) of my rewards by heading to J-Spec, an upscale East Village Japanese restaurant, with Meagan. In honor of Restaurant Week, we were there to try out the $39 prix-fixe wagyu-beef dinner special. While I don’t know if I’d spend $39 on beef again, I could DEFINITELY taste the upgrade.

\[wagyu beef bowl picture]

* It was one of those rare moments where I just wanted to shut up and savor the food. Yes, it was that good. So, despite the high-energy person that I am, I just listened to Meg talk, and took it slow.

\[pic with Meg and Jeff]

* Afterwards, I pestered Meag to come with me to the Spot, a nearby famous dessert restaurant. I love umami meals, but my sweet tooth wouldn’t let me go that easily.

\[the spot dessert menu]

* As a guy who grew up watching Kitchen Nightmares, Masterchef, and all memes Ramsay, I was blown away by the idea of an Asian-American, high end dessert place. It was like my fever dream restaurant had come to life, combining all of my favorite things together, all to enjoy on a perfectly cool summer evening. 

\[the spot restaurant - a super festive vibe, with NO line!]

* The menu had so many items, from matcha lava cakes to golden toast, that it took an agonizing 15 minutes before I settled on the Milky Puff, an exotic concoction composed of bananas, puff pasty, honey comb, corn flakes, and condensed ice cream. 

\[milky puff dessert — caption: it was my affinity to dairy that was the turning point.]

* Beyond the world-class aesthetic, the taste was top 5 of all time. The summer special I ordered included a caramel miso cookie which paired MAGNIFICENTLY with mango main. The warm, gooey, punching flavor of the cookie, complemented by the milky, light, airy flavor of the milky puff… god damn. 

\[harvest + milky puff dessert explanation — caption: the complexity that goes into meg and I’s desserts]

* As usual, the frenzy started to pick up so much by Thursday that it became hard to keep up, in a good way. 
* Friday was especially hard to digest and process. It started off with work slamming me with engagements, spontaneous socializing as I headed into the Chelsea office to meet a fellow intern, and unroutine-like EY-sponsored meals with my counselor. 

\[pic of me with Angelina]

* The day was just starting though. The real action came in the evening, where I was set to hang out with Sarah, one of the skydivers from the Reddit group. I’d cobbled together a list of things in NYC I’d always wanted to do into one packed evening. 

\[Jeff at the CitiBikes at sunset — caption: citiBiking along the Hudson Riverway at sunset (gorgeous!)]

\[edge at night — caption: going up 100+ stories to the edge, one of the highest observation decks in the city.]

* Saturday was interesting, as it started initially as a calm, relaxing day to sleep in and take it easy, and gradually morphed into a day that was just as packed. After both Ming and I’s plans got cancelled last minute, we threw together a tennis slugfest for that afternoon in the bubble. 

\[Union square - stumbled into this farmers market in Union Square on a bright, sunny Saturday afternoon. Definitely gonna come back and scope it out more fully in the future!]

* I was especially inclined to go out in the end rather than relax inside all day because CitiBike was offering free unlimited rides to New Yorkers that Saturday. 

\[TimeOut article on CitiBike — caption: I LOVE TimeOut … would have never found out about this gem otherwise]

* So in a breach of routine, I took advantage of my passport gym pass and squeezed in a workout by the Lexington Ave sister branch. I headed to the gym on Lexington Ave and squeezed in my workout …

\[Lexington NYSC gym bench — caption: this gym’s equipment was considerably nicer than the Chelsea one’s! :o]

* And biked an hour and a half back to the bubble to win a fun French-Open 7-5 7-5 7-5 scored match. It was my dream to play a 5 setter on red clay, so that was an absolute blast.

\[Roosevelt Island - caption: also found THIS gem of an island — there’s a FERRY that takes you over the East River … so cool!]

* Remember how I said life’s surprise could be right around the corner? Well, the most random thing happened in the subway afterwards on the way home. As I was standing waiting for the train, this guy approached me and asked if I played tennis. Turns out this stranger graduated from USC, and worked and lived in Taipei and HK, and speaks fluent mandarin. Furthermore, he was a 4.0 and was interested in hitting more. I did give him my Facebook contact info, but all I could think of doing when I got home was laugh. NYC is a crazy place — where else would something like that, two strangers who would have never met otherwise — meet and connect in a random circumstance like that? 
* In any case, it was only a small delay in my evening, because I was still off to the races. You see, to cap off the Saturday plans I’d cobbled together, I was headed off to grab dinner with Pong, one of the founders of OnTrack, and an old friend I met through DPops. 

\[OnTrack app — caption: Pong showed me what OnTrack had been working on since I interned there two summers ago … cool stuff!]

* After a long back-and-forth on the logistics, we managed to meet up around 9 pm, and grab dinner together with his roommate Abby at one one of the most authentic Japanese ramen restaurant’s I’ve seen. 

\[NR bao — caption: I was starving, and it was sooo oishi]

\[dinner with Pong — caption: this place, NR, was the real deal — it had Toto hand dryers, and the waiters even bowed as we headed out!]

* Pong and I then followed up the meal with a Van Leeuwens ice cream escapade to a nearby park. It was awesome to catch up with Pong, not only because he was doing some really inspiring stuff at McKinsey. Insane work hours and tiredness aside, he was excelling and happy with his job. 
* The interaction made me realize a long-standing phenomenon I had wondered about: what made the people from Yale so special. The answer? Ambition. There’s a fire in people like Pong that I gravitate towards and am fed and inspired by. I like being around smart, driven people who challenge and excite me to become a better version of myself. Not just vocationally like in this example, but also in terms of extracurriculars and passions. Like, we even talked about vlogging and cameras, since Pong is an AV god, and I’d picked up an interest in cinematography over quarantine. 
* Maybe that’s elitist, but maybe not. I see some of these qualities — of being inspired, of learning — in my close friend circle, even from those who didn’t go to elite universities. It’s not like only Yale students have this quality, but it’s definitely in a higher concentration. 
* The other thing about Yale students? A lot of the time, it ends up in new collaborations, new experiences, and new opportunities. After talking about cameras, life, and Yale in this beautiful spot on the UWS, our chat slowly morphed into something with direct implications for my immediate future: an offer to join OnTrack again in the fall. It was smooth, and made sense. I had a lot of the things they needed — time, energy — and they had things I wanted — experience, flexibility, funding. While it’s tentative, the opportunity was now on the table.

* It’s kind of funny how this dinner mirrored my original internship recruiting call freshman year … starting with ramen, and ending with late 3 am conversations. I like to tell myself that life is throwing out opportunities left and right. Maybe it’s because I keep putting myself out there, but I like to think of it as creating my own luck and seizing everything that comes my way. 
* Even though I said it was going to be a slower week for me, it still felt so packed. How perfect though, that it ended the way it started, in a slow and rare Sunday evening to myself. As I reflect, I keep coming to the lesson from my meditation app and the principle of mindfulness. Releasing and embracing the present, paradoxically, is the best thing for staying hungry for a brighter future, because it gives something in short supply nowadays: clarity. 
* Writing this post was a life checkpoint, and maybe by reading this, it will be for you too. Think about your five people. Maybe they’re already who you want them to be. But if they’re not, who do you want them to be? Because that’ll speak volumes on who YOU want to be.
