*Apologies for the supah-late blog - my days in the city have been unbelievably packed, and I've barely had time to squeeze in what was a ROLLERCOASTER of an opening week. Anyway, excited to share everything that's transpired in my first full week in the city. It's hilarious how only a week has passed, and yet it feels like a lifetime ago.* 

"New York is intense." 

Those are the words that Leila, a friend-of-a-friend said to me on Saturday night at 3 am on a rooftap bar hundreds of feet in the sky. And for all purposes, I agreed wholeheartedly. New York is the type of place that either breaks you or makes you; fills you with opportunities or loneliness and dread. It's what you make of it ... a place that **amplifies** your experiences. It gives you the lowest lows, but also the highest highs. 

If pandemic life during covid was a stale cracker, then a summer in the city is like a shot of energy drink. It's a punch in the face.

# one word to describe urban life? stimulating

On one hand, New York provides some amazing opportunities and conveniences. In many senses, it's a microcosm of how I've found work at EY so far: overwhelming, stimulating, advancement. From a first impression, NYC and EY feels like a place where I can rocket my life and career, from learnings and networking to events and socials. There's SO many people and resources that I'm excited to explore and dive into, from badges to volunteering to professional groups. At the same time, especially for the first week, it was overwhelming trying to create some structure for myself.

If there's one thing I love most, though, it's the spontaneity. It's the ability to take an impromptu walk in the sunshine down the street while munching on some snap! mallow! pop! ice cream. Or CitiBike through the bustling streets of Chelsea, pausing and gasping in awe at the gorgeous weather.

Or it's stopping by a random, quaint cafe, getting into a conversation with the bartender about the best haircut spot in town, building a social life in a new city, and hearing about a totally different walk of life.

Anyone who knows me well knows how much I love to constantly be on the move (in Zhuangzian style, according to my Ancient Chinese Thought class). But some of my brightest moments have occurred in the innocuous, like stopping to admire some of my favorite stores on a chance walk.

I legitimately derived so much joy from stopping in Trader Joes and Uniqlo that I felt like I had ascended to consumerist heaven.

![you'll never find someone who geeks out about uniqlo more than me](../uploads/061921_uniqlo_interior.jpeg "you'll never find someone who geeks out about uniqlo more than me")

at the same time, sometimes you gotta recharge, and stopping in a small shaved ice dessert cafe to get some work done is a joy you can only get in a city like the Big Apple.

# a migrant growing his roots 

It's liberating to move to a new city where no one knows you. You can reinvent yourself, shed off old baggage. But it's also terrifying and incredibly easy to become lonely, a migrant. But I'm lucky to have a few buddies from my past, who are there to ease me into my new life. And also there to support me in my self-improvement goals, my adventurous lifestyle, and my terrible jokes and effacing sense of humor ;) ... okay, maybe not that last one.

![omurice, chicken katsu, and more.... SO OISHI](../uploads/061521_dinner_food.jpeg "omurice, chicken katsu, and more.... SO OISHI")

having a friend in the city is also great for those late night, 4am rooftop birthday parties that only true New Yorkers know about ;) all those fashion changes helped me blend right into the smart casual atmosphere, and even though I didn't drink, I was able to match the vibe and fit right into the social dynamics. It was fun ... some of the first fun I've had in months of quarantine.

# 42 habits to success

My buddy Kevin sent me a video while I was in my transitionary period to New York about habits. Apparently, there are 32 habits which can change your life. I had picked up S tier ones without even knowing - including socializing and journaling - and taking this as affirmation, I made it my goal to embrace routine and habit building as a means of self improvement this summer. 

<div class="video-box"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GriR73kSvPY?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

There are some things which I can never give up wherever I travel, and health is one of them. I had researched gyms extensively before coming to the city, and was originally going to go for the cheapest option. (stingy saving habits die hard) However, I must've gotten too accustomed to having a home gym in my garage all year, because that 10 minute walk felt like a lifetime. Shifting from living at home the entire pandemic to walking everywhere in an urban city still left a lot to be desired.

![guess which day was the one i moved into nyc ...](../uploads/061821_health_app_walking.png "guess which day was the one i moved into nyc ...")

Imagine my surprise when the gym nearest my apartment, less than a 3 minute walk, happened to have a corporate partnership with EY, and could offer me a discount! It was the most expensive option out of all of the three, about $50 (so nothing as ludicrous as Equinox's $300 membership), but it came with around a 20% discount, and also complimentary access to any of the gyms across the city. Normally I wouldn't think much of that, but since each gym offered different classes (including yoga, pilates, and dance!), and I was looking to get into those things, I couldn't pass up the opportunity.

![The gym just outside my house. Nothing spectacular, beyond the convenience.](../uploads/061821_nysc_gym.jpeg "The gym just outside my house. Nothing spectacular, beyond the convenience.")

It's taken a while to adjust and coordinate with Jake (my personal trainer who's a good friend of mine) on what machines are available, what routines work best with my hectic schedule, etc. But we treated it as a deload week, which meant shorter workouts and more flexibility with figuring things out. Jake's really helpful in being flexible on that front. 

Another thing that's been a complete overhaul of my life at home is nutrition. As nice as my apartment is, it's still pretty cramped, and the lack of space and sink means weekly meal prep is a logistical nightmare. Especially because I've been trying to watch my macros. As a result, I decided to take the financial hit and buy pre-made meals from ICON Meals after researching a lot of different companies. It's really not that insane to be honest - shipping is free, the meals are freezable, and the pricing is slightly fairer than what Yale Dining would charge. What I really like about ICON is that I can easily customize the portion sizes so I match my macros exactly. And, after the first batch arrived on Tuesday, I was hooked.

![The 14 ICON meals came vacuum sealed and packaged in dry ice ... how dope is that?!](../uploads/061521_premade_icon_meals_box.jpeg "The 14 ICON meals came vacuum sealed and packaged in dry ice ... how dope is that?!")

Beyond nutrition and the gym, I started up another habit that I've been meaning to resume for a while: meditation! My buddy Zach from Taiwan helped me get a free subscription to a meditation app called Waking Up, and I've taken it upon myself to spend 10 minutes each morning before work to calm my mind. It's really done wonders for giving me that peace of mind and lack of insanity for even a small period during the day. While I must admit that I'm far from a meditation master, and my thoughts often cloud my mind and surface like flies from a jar, I do think learning to "sharpen my mind" is a skill I'll eventually develop through this consistent practice. 

Not all habits are enjoyable. Waking up at 7 am each day for work to fit in breakfast and my morning routine is a drag. Working 9-5 and sitting in 8-hour zoom calls (yes, you read that right) for training is a drag. But I'm trying to focus on the positive, and capitalizing on my time here in the city.

# going off-script

but, even the meticulous and structured guy that i am, who wants to live in a world of total predictability? While my schedule is absolutely crammed and unfortunately doesn't leave much room for outings into the city, I committed to getting out into new areas whenever I could. That was my mentality when I chose to take a random stroll Friday night in Greenwich Village, a bustling nearby neighborhood.

![couldn't resist seeing what the hype was all about after seeing the line stretching down half the street](../uploads/061821_gentile_gelato.jpeg "couldn't resist seeing what the hype was all about after seeing the line stretching down half the street")

As fastidiously as I've been sticking to my diet, I couldn't help but cave and grab some of the famed gelato from this place. I've always been afraid of talking to strangers and making a scene, but I forced myself to overcome this fear by getting into a conversation with the well-dressed Italian man standing in line with his wife. I didn't think initially much of it, but after asking him about the gelato at the place, he went off on a 10 minute passionate tangent on how the gelato was one of the best in the city. He then proceeded to translate all the flavors and recommend his favorite flavors. It was pretty incredible. New Yorkers really are an interesting bunch, when you get to know them.

Oh, and btw, that ice cream was delicious.

![some almond and old cream flavor .... already forgot the italian name but it was DELISH](../uploads/061821_gentile_gelato_cup.jpeg "some almond and old cream flavor .... already forgot the italian name but it was DELISH")

when I say New Yorkers are interesting though ... I'm not kidding. I went out Saturday night to wander around, stumbling into the Chinatown and Little Italy area after shopping in SoHo on a whim.

![such a quaint street!! i stumbled on this place by chance because i loved the vibe, but apparently Mulberry St is THE place to go in Little Italy](../uploads/061921_little_italy.jpeg "such a quaint street!! i stumbled on this place by chance because i loved the vibe, but apparently Mulberry St is THE place to go in Little Italy")

# interns meet hoboken and smorgasburg 

as great as exploring the city is, unprompted, though, it's almost guaranteed that I would never run into some of the people that I actually DID want to run into at some point - my fellow EY interns. As a result, my "one new area a day" challenge came in handy here, as I used a trick that my brother suggested: say I'm going to go do an event, and then say people are welcome to come "with." This makes it way less pressuring for people to come along. And plus, I was planning to explore solo anyway, so it was pretty genuine.

![didn't even realize Hoboken and NJ were so dang close](../uploads/061921_hoboken_path_station.jpeg "didn't even realize Hoboken and NJ were so dang close")

luckily, I didn't have to plan the first outing, as I hopped on some other intern's meetup instead. Taiwan was **really** great practice for learning how to proactively build social networks, as our recruiters didn't really host in-person events the first week. I knew sporadic social events wouldn't be enough for me, so I decided to take it upon myself to start hosting some of the socials. For this one in particular, it was pretty loosely-organized (just meeting in front of the Hoboken EY office), which was cool with me. here were supposed to be like 8 people, but not surprisingly, as I've learned over the year, people are flakes, and only three of us showed up, including me. But it didn't really bother me - that type of noncommital is something I've grown to expect by now, and it only meant that I got more time to soak in the beautiful views ...

![an escape from the city, in a beautiful waterfront overlooking Manhattan](../uploads/061921_hoboken_riverside_fountain.jpeg "an escape from the city, in a beautiful waterfront overlooking Manhattan")

enjoy my first genuine NYC burger which absolutely SLAPPED ...

![angus steak and pepper burger ... Ram said it'd be yummy, and he wasn't kidding.](../uploads/061921_burger.jpeg "angus steak and pepper burger ... Ram said it'd be yummy, and he wasn't kidding.")

and unlike when shoved in a breakout room with 20 people, genuinely connect with two pretty damn cool interns. 

![Jeff (left), Ram (middle), and Pranay (right) in the first social of the summer!](../uploads/061921_hoboken_interns_meal.jpeg "Jeff (left), Ram (middle), and Pranay (right) in the first social of the summer!")

Funnily enough, they were actually both from the Hoboken area, so I also got a free, impromptu tour of downtown afterwards, getting to see all the cool spots in town.

![wonder whose office this is O-O](../uploads/061921_ey_hoboken_office.jpeg "wonder whose office this is O-O")

Also managed to organize something on my own, heading to Smorgasburg, a major food festival in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, and unleash my inner foodie. It was relatively far for me, but it was a great excuse to get out of Manhattan and do some of that city-wide travelling I said I would do earlier on.

![The Taiwan feels ... the Taiwan feels](../uploads/062021_taiwan_stand.jpeg "The Taiwan feels ... the Taiwan feels")

I got a ton of interest, over 14 people who I added to a group chat, but only one other person showed up, Danielle. Looks like flaking is universal, but to be honest, it didn't really get on my psyche that much. I guess I've been used to it as I've gotten older and become more cynical, and not let it get to me personally. All the better though, as I got to really have some time to get to know another intern, Danielle! Quality over quantity.

![Me and Danielle, ](../uploads/062021_smorgasburg_jeff_danielle.jpeg)

If there's one thing I've noticed over the past few study abroad experiences, though, it's that I've got SUPER comfortable with opening up and talking to strangers in new situations. It's crazy how much I've changed since that shy, introverted, closed off boy three years ago. I felt positive, open to talking to strangers, and just so incredibly socially charged that Danielle even misidentified me as extroverted. HAHA.  

Intern socials are one way to meet people, but one thing I've noticed is that despite there being HUNDREDS of interns in our class, very, very few in proportion are willing to meet up, for logistical or personal reasons. Like, our GroupMes have 300+ people, but there might only be ~50 people max who are even interested in socializing, and only 1-25 of them will actually go to events. It's kinda sad, but I haven't let it get to my psyche. Instead, I've tried to fill that void by joining some classes and hobbies, not just to meet new people, but also because they align really well with my goals to get out of my comfort zone and confront my fears. 

This week, the big event was signing up for a comedy improv class on Monday. I've always been TERRIFIED of performing and making a fool of myself on stage. Sure, I've performed in recitals and stuff, but that type of performance is expected. Comedy improv though? You could easily make a fool of yourself. But that's exactly what I know I should do it, so I signed up for a Sunday class to push myself. When else will I get the opportunity to do something like this? And while I hesitated so, so much to sign up, I felt a deeper sense of pride and relief in the days afterwards, coming from knowing that I was living my life the way I wanted to. I also signed up for a co-ed beach volleyball league ... I've never been a beach person, but it seemed pretty fun and a cool way to explore a new part of the city (Riverside Park)

# strangers and spice

## breaking the ice

I wasn't sure if I was going to include this section here, but I decided that it would be against my goals if I didn't. It's been my goal to open up and be honest to the people around me, and this is one step in that direction. 

One thing I've always struggled with is learning to open myself up socially. I've always thought of it as "weird" to strike up conversations with people, or downright creepy. But the reality is that a lot of those thoughts are misguided, as long as you do things with respect and decency. In fact, learning to break the ice with strangers is oftentimes a way to brighten people's days. It's something that forces me not to just go through life on autopilot, but actively throw myself out of my comfort zone each and every day. 

So, I've picked up the stranger of talking to strangers throughout the week, just complimenting people on their clothes. Something I've always wanted to work on about myself was not being a bystander, and this was.an extension of smile routine in Taiwan. Some experiences were minor, like complimenting a guy on his JCrew tshirt in Rite Aid. Others were interesting, like getting into a conversation with a guy on the subway about thrifting in NYC and his background coming from Germany. Some were shockingly impactful, like meeting the cafe bartender on Monday that I mentioned earlier, and learning where to get my haircut and how many New Yorkers went through the same uprooting process. Through it all, the old maxim of practice making perfect has held true. From being incredibly, incredibly awkward at the beginning, I've slowly become more desensitized to the awkwardness and more comfortable brightening other people's days. 

## catching fire

As for spicing things up ... let's take about a little romance :p yessir, your boy is on the dating market. I've always been terrified of leaving myself vulnerable and putting myself out there. But after two years of self-development, meeting some incredible people abroad with healthy relationships, and some nudging from some important friends and family, I decided to take the plunge and put myself on all the major ones: Tinder, Coffee and Bagel, Bumble, and Hinge. Won't go into too much detail, but it's been an absolute rollercoaster. 

I got very addicted to swiping at the beginning. After being at home for so long, being in the middle of nowhere, it was crazy to be with so many people my age around me. The even crazier thing? After wasting tons of time on Tinder with no results, I was getting SO many matches on Hinge. I attribute it to being able to set girls who are my demographic and type, but I found some of the matches I got were pretty good fits. As someone who's always struggled with self-esteem, that was a major validation boost.

Of course, all of it came crashing down when I discovered the truth about the NY dating market, and how flakey it is. I didn't do a rigorous statistical analysis, but I would say in that first week, out of the 13 matches I got (which was a mind blowing number for someone who didn't expect any), 70% didn't respond to the first message, and the other 30% got a single message in before being completely ghosted. That was pretty soul crushing, putting so many exhausting hours swiping, making conversation, only for things to lead to dead ends left and right. Thursday in particular was a rough night, and I could feel sour thoughts swirling in my head like ominous clouds. 

In the depths of these disappointments, I started to embrace an alternative mindset at the end of the week though: nonneediness. I think it's so easy to get sucked into the dating game and become needy, but the truly healthy way of dealing with this initial stage of searching is nonneediness, or being able to walk away. I wouldn't have had the courage to do that in the past, but after developing a circle of supportive friends, opening up, living a better lifestyle, shedding some toxic conceptions about masculinity, and actually getting matches, I'd say I have the healthiest mindset about dating I've had in forever. I just hope I can sustain it. Dating is a numbers game, and the moment I give up is the moment I stop progressing. Resiliency, the ability to bounce back from failure, is the path to success. It's all in my head.

I'd say the most eye-opening moment I had was on Saturday night, when I told the girl at the dessert cafe she was cute and walked out. It might seem so silly, so stupid, but for me, it was a HUGE step forward. She smiled, flattered, and I walked out into the night. No creepy stares. No creepy police. Just ending the situation with a net positive, brightening both of ours days.

The second eye-opening moment moment? Getting a number from dating apps on Sunday night. Another first step, baby step, in the right direction.

# looking forward

I haven't had, like, ANY time at all to reflect and re-evaluate if my experience is up to my expectations. But if there's one thing I learned early on in the week that's stuck with me to this point, it's that all of my valuable experiences have happened OUTSIDE my apartment, and as much as I hate things that push me outside of my comfort zone, I know that doing these types of activities will help me grow so much, and be the most memorable activities from this summer.
