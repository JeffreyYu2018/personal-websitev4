A massive heat wave hit the city this week, with temps pushing into the high 90s, and as my friend Meg put it tongue-in-cheek, it's "Your first NYC heat wave <3." After weathering the bitterly cold upstate winters all year, it caught me off guard to be so close to nature's might by being outside again. But honestly, the heat really wasn't that bad by dressing appropriately - it was more than manageable, in fact. I'm glad I got my summer clothes early, because I would be suffocating in jeans and jackets.
