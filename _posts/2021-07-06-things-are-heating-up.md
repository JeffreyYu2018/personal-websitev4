A massive heat wave hit the city this week, with temps pushing into the high 90s, and as my friend Meg put it tongue-in-cheek, it was "Your first NYC heat wave <3." After weathering bitterly cold upstate winters all year inside my heated home, it caught me off guard to have to walk outside again and endure nature's might. But by dressing appropriately, the heat was more than manageable. I'm glad I got my summer clothes early, because I would otherwise be suffocating in jeans and jackets.

At least it was gorgeous outside in the blazingly sunny heat.

I could only take so much gorgeousness though before needing to escape to some air-conditioned haven on Monday. Luckily, a cute Italian pastry shop I found in SoHo did the trick. A perfect place to sit down, munch on a light dessert, and blog for a couple hours.

Heat was the theme this week. Things got even spicier when I headed to my hip hop dance class on Tuesday. This week, we learned a new clean set of moves. Feeling more comfortable, I actually started getting the hang of it. It helped that no one else had done this choreography before, but also, practice makes perfect, and Russell (the teacher) was great at teaching the moves at a slower pace. As always, it was so dang fun, and got me buzzed afterwards on natural endorphins.

Skipping over Wednesday (went on a first date that day), let's go to Thursday. Decided to go to an intern hangout in the Hoboken office, and wowie, I'm glad I did. I've always been looking for excuses to go into the office to partially recreate the in-person internship experience, and also excuses to meet other interns, and this was a perfect way to kill two birds with one stone.

![on the 30 min commute to hoboken](../uploads/070121_subway_to_hoboken_office.jpeg "on the 30 min commute to hoboken")

After spending a year WFH, I couldn't believe how much I loved returning to the office. I'm more productive - having three monitors is soo helpful, along with a dedicated place to work. I'm more happy - being around people and having small talk are things I really missed as an omnivert. And finally, the professional opportunities - it is SO much easier to do coffee chats and hallway conversations in-person than scheduling it on a calendar.

Not to mention, the office is just damn aesthetic. Photo dump incoming.

I loved the office so much, in fact, that I headed there again on Friday. Mom, who was visiting in town for the weekend, needed a day to herself to go shopping in SoHo and walk around the High Line, so it worked out perfectly. Hoboken's also just a really nice area to work in.

![who knew there were so many events right across the river in hoboken??](../uploads/070221_hoboken_events.jpeg "who knew there were so many events right across the river in hoboken??")

There was something ominous about how the office was deserted though. To be fair, it was the day before the week-long holiday that EY gives us, and half of my engagement team wasn't even online. In fact, it felt like I was the only one there. That being said, it was a chill day. I spent most of it networking, killing time with Udemy tutorials relevant to my project, and soaking in the amazing views for myself.

As for other stunning views, I transferred at the WTC subway station on the way back from the office, and was thrilled to finally see the Oculus. It was completely spontaneous to take a different, longer route home, but I'm glad I did, since I got to knock off another thing off my list. 

![best detour I could have taken](../uploads/070221_oculus.jpeg "best detour I could have taken")

That was pretty much the end of my self-exploration though, as I spent the rest of the week with other people. As I mentioned, my mom was in town since Thursday, so after a busy work day on Friday, we headed for some touristy sites. Mom loves flowers, so she wanted to visit the New York Botanical Garden. It was an hour commute, but it was worth getting out of Manhattan on a chilly rainy day.

![](../uploads/070321_jeff_mom_botanical_garden_selfie.jpeg)

Personally, I'm not a big fan of gardens, so we mutually agreed to split up, with her walking around while I headed to a cafe to catch up on some work, including blogs. 

![Breakfast blogs in the Bronx](../uploads/070321_blogging_in_bronx.jpeg "Breakfast blogs in the Bronx")

If breakfast was simple, though, dinner was anything but. Mom and I are huge foodies, so we went to a Michelin 2-star Scandanavian restaurant called Aquavit for dinner. We were both gonna get the 5-course tasting menus, but we decided to split two prix-fixe three-course menus for the variety and price. Needless to say, it was absolutely insane in quality, and I just closed my eyes and enjoyed the depth and dimension of flavors in each dish. You can find the menu [here.](<https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54288085e4b0461906627747/t/60de24934e678d3098895c3d/1625171091150/DR+07.01.21.pdf

If there was a dish that stole the show, though, by and far, it would be the "Arctic Bird's Nest" dessert. Aesthetically stunning, my mind exploded while I tasted all the flavors ... the tart raspberry, the sweet yogurt, the crunchy birds nest. It was a soul transcending foodie experience.

Mom and I are NOT the types to blow money on luxuries like this often. But she's only in New York so rarely, and we just endured two years of hell in the form of covid, so we figured we could treat ourselves this one time :)

That was far from the end of the weekend chaos though. If anything, Sunday, the 4th of July was when the event sparks started flying (pun intended - trying to tie this into the theme of the post HAHA). No, not romantically, if that's what you're thinking ... that was earlier in the week on Wednesday. I mean fireworks! 

It was an INSANELY busy Sunday, but the beginning started calm enough. Mom and I visited Little Island, a cute new public floating park right next to my house in the Chelsea area.

![just so lively ... made me so happy seeing the people milling around on a beautiful 4th](../uploads/070421_little_island_view.jpeg "just so lively ... made me so happy seeing the people milling around on a beautiful 4th")

After that, we wandered around Chelsea market and grabbed some Thai lunch with Mom's doctor friends.

![](../uploads/070421_chelsea_market.jpeg)

Then finally, I walked mom to the bus stop and dropped her off.

I came home mid-day, sweaty, tired, wanting to chill, but in the spirit of the Fourth of July, I got off my ass (after cooking for the week) and headed to my next destination: Coney Island. Things are no fun if you stay home all the time!

There, I spent the rest of the evening and night with Ram, one of the interns from our EY cohort, which was fun. We were shootin the shit, walking around, hangin' out ... the works.

![quick bites](../uploads/070421_coney_island_food_stall.jpeg "quick bites")

I'm finally glad to have befriended some thrill seekers in this stage of my life, because I got to do something I had been itching to do for months ... ride a legit rollercoaster! The Cyclone was a wooden bull that kicked us around and gave **serious** airtime. I had forgotten how much I loved that gut-dropping thrill ... no wonder I'm going skydiving next week. ;)

![went on "the cyclone" twice!](../uploads/070421_coney_island_cyclone.jpeg "went on \\"the cyclone\\" twice!")

![ignore that watermark ;) we're just edgy like that](../uploads/070421_coney_island_rollercoaster.jpeg "ignore that watermark ;) we're just edgy like that")

I don't know if it was just because it was the 4th, but the atmosphere was sooo festive. It literally felt like a state fair.

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_state_fair.jpeg)

It was enlivening to stroll around and see what all the hype was all about. We even got to eat at some iconic locations, like Nathan's, home of the famous hot dog eating contest!

The lines to get food, though, did suck. It stretched the width of the boardwalk, and it took 45+ minutes just to order.

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_boardwalk.jpeg)

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_beach.jpeg)

But I tried to view the packed-ness in a positive light, and see it as only adding to the festivity. New York had finally started to return to its dense, chaotic normal.

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_sunset.jpeg)

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_ferris_wheel.jpeg)

What started with a relatively slow day at Little Island ended with a suitable bang. Ram and I were so lucky, because we managed to get on the Ferris Wheel (the Wonder Wheel) the MOMENT that the fireworks started at 10 pm. As a result, we got a view of all of the fireworks across the city, not just the ones in Coney Island, but also in Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn. Visually spectacular. 

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_ram_and_jeff.jpeg)

And what better way to end the celebrations with a staple: funnel cake?

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_funnel_cake.jpeg)

Fireworks, ferris wheels, funnel cake, fun… what a way to cap off a heated week. With next week off from work, and with new activities like my co-ed volleyball league and comedy-improv group starting, cheers to another week of highlights.
