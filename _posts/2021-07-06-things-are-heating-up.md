A massive heat wave hit the city this week, with temps pushing into the high 90s, and as my friend Meg put it tongue-in-cheek, it's "Your first NYC heat wave <3." After weathering the bitterly cold upstate winters all year, it caught me off guard to be so close to nature's might by being outside again. But honestly, the heat really wasn't that bad by dressing appropriately - it was more than manageable, in fact. I'm glad I got my summer clothes early, because I would be suffocating in jeans and jackets.

Not to mention, it was gorgeous outside.

I could only take so much gorgeousness though before needing to escape to some air-conditioned haven, though. Luckily, this cute Italian pastry shop I found in SoHo did the trick. Perfect place to sit down, enjoy a light dessert, and blog for a couple hours.

Things got spicy again when I headed to my hip hop dance class on Tuesday, and we learned a new set of moves. This week, feeling more comfortable, I actually started getting the hang of it. It helped that no one else had done this set of moves before, but also, I just think practice makes perfect, and Russell (the teacher) was great at taking the class at a slower pace. It was also, as always, so dang fun, and got me buzzed afterwards.

Skipping over Wednesday for now, let's go to Thursday. Decided to go to an intern hangout in the Hoboken office, and wowie, I'm glad I did. 

![on the 30 min commute to hoboken](../uploads/070121_subway_to_hoboken_office.jpeg "on the 30 min commute to hoboken")

After spending a year WFH, I couldn't believe how much I loved returning to one. I'm more productive - having three monitors is soo helpful, along with a dedicated place to work. I'm more happy - being around people and having small talk are things I really missed as an omnivert. And finally, the professional opportunities - it is SO much easier to do coffee chats and hallway conversations this way than scheduling it on a calendar.

Not to mention, the office is just damn aesthetic. Photo dump incoming.

I loved the office so much, in fact, that I headed there again on Friday. Hoboken's also just a really nice area to work in.

![who knew there were so many events right across the river in hoboken??](../uploads/070221_hoboken_events.jpeg "who knew there were so many events right across the river in hoboken??")

There was something ominous about how the office was deserted though. To be fair, it was the day before the week-long holiday that EY gives us, and half of my engagement team wasn't even in the office. In fact, it felt like I was the only one there. That being said, it was a chill day, and it only left more room for the amazing views for myself. 

![](../uploads/070221_hoboken_office_empty_view.jpeg)

As for other amazing views, I stopped by the WTC subway station on the way back from the office, and was thrilled to finally see the Oculus. It was completely spontaneous, but I'm glad I got to knock off yet ANOTHER thing off my list. 

![best detour I could have taken](../uploads/070221_oculus.jpeg "best detour I could have taken")

That was pretty much the end of my self-exploration though, as I spent the rest of the week with other people. My mom was in town since Thursday, so after a busy work day on Friday, we headed for some touristy sites. Mom loves flowers, so she wanted to visit the New York Botanical Garden. It was an hour commute, but it was great to get out of the Manhattan area on a chilly rainy day.

Personally, I'm not a big fan, so we mutually agreed to split up, with her walking around without me as baggage while I headed to a cafe to catch up on some work, including blogs. 

![Breakfast blogs in the Bronx](../uploads/070321_blogging_in_bronx.jpeg "Breakfast blogs in the Bronx")

If breakfast was simple, though, dinner was anything but. Mom and I are huge foodies, so we went to a Michelin 2-star Scandanavian restaurant called Aquavit for dinner. We were both gonna get the 5-course tasting menus, but we decided to split two prix-fixe three-course menus for the variety and price. Needless to say, it was absolutely insane in quality, and I just closed my eyes and enjoyed the depth and dimension of flavors in each dish. PC: Mom.

![](../uploads/070321_michelin_jeff_eating_lobster.jpeg)

If there was a dish that stole the show, though, by and far, it would be the "Arctic Bird's Nest" dessert. Aesthetically stunning, my mind exploded while I tasted all the flavors ... it was a soul transcending foodie experience.

It was a rare boogie way to wrap up my Saturday.

That was far from the end of the weekend chaos though. If anything, Sunday, the 4th of July was when the event sparks started flying (pun intended - trying to tie this into the theme of the post HAHA). No, not romantically, if that's what you're thinking ... I mean fireworks! 

It was an INSANELY busy day, but the beginning of the day started calm enough. Mom and I visited Little Island right next to my house.

After that we wandered around Chelsea market and grabbed some brunch with Mom's doctor friends...

![](../uploads/070421_chelsea_market.jpeg)

Then finally walked mom to the bus stop and dropped her off.

I came home, sweaty, tired, wanting to chill, but in the spirit of the Fourth of July, I got off my ass (after cooking for the week) and headed to my next destination: Coney Island.

I spent the rest of the day with Ram, one of the interns from our EY cohort, which was fun. We were shootin the shit, walking around, hanging out ... the works.

I'm finally glad to have befriended some thrill seekers in this stage of my life, because I got to do something I had been itching to do for months ... ride a legit rollercoaster!

![went on "the cyclone" twice!](../uploads/070421_coney_island_cyclone.jpeg "went on \"the cyclone\" twice!")

![ignore that watermark ;) we're just edgy like that](../uploads/070421_coney_island_rollercoaster.jpeg "ignore that watermark ;) we're just edgy like that")

The atmosphere was so festive ... it literally felt like a state fair.

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_state_fair.jpeg)

Even got to eat at some iconic locations, like Nathan's, home of the famous hot dog eating contest!

It was **absolutely** packed overall, though, and some of the lines were crazy. 

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_boardwalk.jpeg)

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_beach.jpeg)

But if anything, this only added to the festivity, and reminded me that New York had finally started ton return to its chaotic normal.

What better way to cap off an explosive week than with a bang ... Ram and I were so lucky, because we managed to get on the Ferris Wheel (the Wonder Wheel) the MOMENT that the fireworks started at 10 pm. As a result, we got a view of all of the fireworks across the city ... it was visually spectacular. 

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_ram_and_jeff.jpeg)

And what better way to end the celebrations with a staple, funnel cake?

![](../uploads/070421_coney_island_funnel_cake.jpeg)

Fireworks, Ferris wheels, funnel cake, fun… rollercoasters, festivities, fun… what a way to cap off a heated week.
