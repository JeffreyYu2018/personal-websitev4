Travel blog, long time no see. It's time for my latest adventure: a summer in the City. While this isn't technically "studying abroad" in a foreign country, I've never lived in the City before, despite living within three hours of it. Furthermore, after spending an entire YEAR on Zoom University, being anywhere that isn't my home in upstate New York is exotic at this point.
