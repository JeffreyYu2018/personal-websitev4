*Sorry for the slightly late blog. I got back home late Sunday night from my weekend trip and didn't have an opportunity to finish blogging. I'm going to keep this blog shorter since my time is limited more than usual, as I'm writing this post during my weekday nights rather than Sunday afternoon.*

# weekly recap

## lighting it up

On Monday, I headed way down to the southern part of Taiwan to Fuhe Riverside Park with Bello. It was awesome because it was a 30-40 minute ride by public transit (way out of the way), so I knew I was heading to a place I wouldn't normally go to (or discover) thanks to my language exchange.

Bello had brought some fireworks she got from a shop in the city, and after walking along the coast for an hour, we set up shop in a little area with some lights around. We started off with lighting some sprinklers, which were fun to play with.

They were also super photogenic and led to a lot of funny photos, like this Harry Potter-esque one.

We ended with a bang, setting off a box of packaged fireworks at the end. It was super thrilling because unlike in America, it was legal to do it in Taiwan without a license. We were in a public public and oohed and aahed as they literally exploded right in front of us. Overall, it was an awesome experience.

## eating like an american again ... kinda

On Tuesday, I got lunch at a Taiwanese steak place (牛排馆) with Yvonne. This one was special because it had unlimited bread AND ice cream. 

Our slang conversation kind of died out in recent exchanges, so I switched to a new topic which stuck (surprisingly) more deeply: politics. Yvonne was apparently a politics major before she switched to accounting, so we got into an interesting discussion about the American and Taiwanese political landscape. I also got her advice on the post-ICLP trip I'm planning.

## spin heaven ... and a mysterious feeling of dissatisfaction

On Wednesday, after my new language partner Kelly flaked for the second time, I decided to stop trying to keep in contact with her. I'm not going to tolerate anyone who can't keep up their end of the deal, especially when I have so many other awesome language partners.

It worked out, because I had extra time to play tennis. I got my rackets restrung to add extra spin to the ball, so it was kicking up even higher. My hitting partner, Kevin, described it as follows: before the ball would kick up to his shoulders, but now it kicked up over his head. HAHA.

After tennis, I took the evening to chill and really relax, checking into the week. I was craving meat so I picked a tonkatsu place in Gongguan, an area I wanted to explore more.

It was nice to relax, but it was also at this point that I started feeling this uncomfortable hole in my stomach, as if I was unsatisfied with something. I was confused because I was living according to my values and had days full of activities, but something was missing. At the time, I thought it was because things were starting to become routine-like, which hit kind of close to the truth, but it was only during my reflection that I realized why I had hit a lull. (*More on that at the very end of this post.)*

## an average day

On Thursday, I got dinner with Doris. It was nothing special, and we just talked about a bunch of random topics.

![Doris and Jeff selfie](../uploads/051420_dinner_doris_selfie.jpg "Doris and Jeff selfie")

I headed to the teaching club meeting afterwards with her, but it was there I found out that they were doing some important preparation for the weekend teaching trip, which I wasn't participating in, so I headed home early to not disturb them and do more work.

## finals and the start of the big trip

Finals at ICLP were on Friday, and they were pretty easy. In fact, I barely prepared and still managed to attain top marks afterwards. I credit paying attention all semester and reviewing vocabulary each day for allowing me to have a smooth end to the semester.

After finals, I headed home to pack and leave for the big weekend trip. The president of the NTU Traveler Club had reached out to me about this excursion they'd organized with rafting and river tracing, so I invited some of my foreigner friends to come along. 

After I headed to the meeting point and boarded the bus, we were off to our hostel in Hualien. We sang karaoke on the bus, which was cool because I got to hear a bunch of Taiwanese songs (and sing English ones). I also got hyped looking at some street style outfits on Instagram, inspiring me to completely revamp my wardrobe when I return to America. (I have to have something to look forward to, after all!)

On a side note, I was amazed by this rest stop that we visited on the way!

## gorgeous views, rafting, and more

Saturday was a really packed day. We were lucky because it was supposed to rain all weekend, but we got sun instead and managed to do all of the activities we had planned.

We visited Qingxingtan beach ...

Went white water rafting in Hualien ...

And hung out with some great friends!

## baos, river tracing, and more beautiful views

Sunday was another packed day filled with activities. It started raining, so there were some minor changes to our itinerary, but we got to do all of the fun stuff we had originally planned.

I ate some of Hualien's famous baos ...

![I originally only bought 8, but I ate 13, haha, because they were so good (and my friends couldn't finish them)](../uploads/051720_delicious_bao.jpg "Baos")

Had my first experience river tracing (in Yilan) ...

![Jeff leaping off from a cliff while river tracing](../uploads/051720_river_tracing_leap.jpg "Jeff leaping off from a cliff while river tracing")

And strolled around in a beautiful park and was treated to some more jaw-dropping views.

Some other stuff happened on Sunday from being in a very social environment, which helped me realize four stark truths about my life. That is to say, I started to do some serious reflection on some of the things I've learned from my time abroad. Like I've mentioned before, not all of it is going to be rosy. Hopefully you can gain some insight into your own life after seeing these points.

# four truths

## 1. people will respect you when you live according to your own values

I had learned this before from a charisma workshop, but going abroad and experiencing it for myself really nailed this point home for me. 

To give a concrete example of this in action, during lunch on Sunday, I was being super silly in order to build rapport with the Taiwanese students. Even though my friends were roasting me, saying I was acting childish and like a middle schooler, and how they couldn't believe I was on this topic again, yada yada yada, I was happy to be trying to build a connection with them the way that I knew how.

I've been learning how to filter out negativity and not sacrifice the parts of myself that make me who I am, because I know that the people who I choose to be in my life will respect that. 

In other words, I've been learning how to embrace my weirdness, because doing so has surprisingly made me my foreigner friends laugh and enjoy my presence more. **It's almost a contradiction; by standing out and being different, even outright weird, people will respect you more.**

## 2. people don't care about the dark stuff you're going through

I had some tough personal experiences while abroad, and while this truth might be hard for some people to hear (especially optimists), it's **the number one most important** thing I've learned while abroad.

We all have our own issues, and even though friends are there to help us through them, their patience has a limit. Yes, I talked with my friends about some inner demons I was going through, but I noticed almost immediately that when I did so, their attention spans reached a limit.

Why do I say this? Don't get me wrong, my social life has improved to a point that I've never experienced before and I'm so grateful for it. That being said, I've noticed a few realities from this. For one, when I was fun and energetic, others reflecting my energy and were really eager to respond to me, but when I started talking about the more moody stuff, they tuned out.

I'm honestly okay with this, because embracing it now will save some heartaches and pains later. Learning to filter out the negative stuff in my interactions with others has saved me a lot of trouble, because I know that ultimately at the end of the day, it's up to me to deal with my own problems, not other people. That's not to say friends can't be helpful; it's just that you really can't count on anyone other than yourself in your darkest moments. It's both a blessing and a curse.

## 3. my greatest weakness is a fear of failure

After the lull on Wednesday, I thought about it long and hard, and came to a realization as to why I felt a lull in my time abroad. It wasn't because I wasn't bored with the activities going on. **No, it was because I was living in my comfort zone, not changing things up, and neglecting challenging myself to fail.**

After reaching one of the peaks of my study abroad experience last week, I've reached a standstill where I've stopped changing things up. Specifically, I've stopped changing things up **in order to improve something about me.**

One of the areas I've been trying to work on, for example, is social in nature: approach anxiety. I was nervous to approach the Taiwanese students on the trip at times given the language barrier, and it really rubbed into me later on. I realize that this is fundamentally my greatest weakness and was developed while growing up in an environment that didn't encourage failure. Constantly striving for the highest awards, the best school, etc. didn't leave a lot of margin for error and risk. 

To fix this issue, I'm going to take concrete steps next week to overcome this: specifically, utilizing a new behavior called Smile Therapy. Basically, it involves approaching strangers on the street and complimenting them in order to get them to smile, thus helping me subconsciously associate approaches with positive emotions. By overcoming this approach anxiety through concrete baby steps, I believe I can revitalize my study abroad experience and achieve my full potential.

## 4. only trust yourself

Close friends and family might give you advice, but at the end of the day, they'll probably disagree, and in this situation, I've realized that my life **is my own.** I have different values from everyone else, and I'm going to live by them rather than the ones of other people.

There are things in my life that have worked that haven't worked for others; for example, taking a concrete, step-by-step approach to solve any problem, academic, extracurricular, even social (!). It's in line with my personality and plays to my strengths, even if it goes against those who think this approach is "unnatural" and too methodical. **I've learned to embrace being different and to act in a way that I'm proud of, that is, act according to my values, and to ignore other people who try to make me stray away from them.** 

Those are the four truths, and that wraps up my blog post. Next week I'll chronicle the effect of Smile Therapy and continue to keep you updated on my adventures. **Until then, remember: baby steps to giant strides!**
