\[exploring greenwich park, getting out of the house, DON'T mention the cold approach I did]

[going along the theme of organized spontaneity ... hip hop dance class was one of the best things I've joined so far. always wanted to learn how to dance better, and this summer being the summer of yes, i thought of pushing myself out of my comfort zone and learning, especially because its included in my gym membership![

[i've learned a lot about positive frames while here - i knew i was getting out of my comfort zone and have two left feet, but by going in with a smile no matter how goofy I looked, laughing at my badness and embracing it, then this positive energy reverberates through the room. its all about attitude. whenever facing something negative, facing it with humor and laughter goes a long way\

\[luckily, the people in the dance class are SO good and ALSO nonjudgmental - my mind was blown]

\[work - started off doing a lot of software dev, which honestly wasn't what I was looking for with this internship. however, i talked with my senior, and he said that he was willing to make it more business and strategy and client-facing, which i'm happy about. also have been trying to ask more questions at work]

\[kind of balancing the home life by also eating pre-cooked meals - pre-prepared ones, but trying to change it up each week]

\[Also thought since it was the summer, I could say screw it, let's get a new haircut too! So I followed up on my lead from last weekend and went to see AJ at Village Cuts on a Wed evening as specifically recommended by Andrew, and yeah, he was WAY more open, hospitable, and cool than my other barber. it's funny how I met him - as i stepped up the stairs, i had to sidestep two guys on the stairs smoking. one of them even smiled at me. after stepping into the cuts place, i asked for aj, only to find out that one of the guys who smiled at me on the stairs was him!  I got into a conversation with him about his family and how he was from Kyrgyzstan, and apparently how we were both into building our own PCs! also talked about cool food spots in the city, and his life ever since moving here. super, super cool guy, also, he took almost a full hour to my haircut and was really methodical about it, taking his time, being precise. so my haircut was way better, and im definitely gonna come back]
